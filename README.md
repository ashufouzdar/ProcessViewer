# ProcessViewer
 I would like to showcase a small utility which I developed for keeping track of
some process management tasks using a pleasant user interface. The bare idea I had in mind
was to develop a utility which can sit in the system tray and provide a mechanism to keep track of process startups and shutdowns and show the alert using some UI dialog. The utility being
developed is based on the mechanism of WMI architecture. It uses WMI to query process list, and to set process event handler.
